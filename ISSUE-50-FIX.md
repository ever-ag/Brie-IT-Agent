# Issue #50 Fix: Membership Check Before Approval

## Problem
When a user requests access to an SSO group they're already a member of:
1. System creates IT approval request
2. Then checks membership and discovers they're already a member
3. Shows both messages (approval submitted + already a member)
4. Approval still goes through unnecessarily

## Root Cause
In `handle_sop_sso_request()` function (line 206), the membership check was missing.
The check existed in the pending selection handler (line 3744) but not in the direct SSO request path.

## Solution
Added membership check AFTER extraction but BEFORE creating approval request.

### Code Changes
**File:** `lambda_it_bot_fixed.py`
**Location:** Lines 291-325 (after line 289 where `extracted_data` is parsed)

```python
# Check membership BEFORE creating approval
membership_status = check_membership(extracted_data['user_email'], extracted_data['group_name'])

if membership_status == "ALREADY_MEMBER":
    msg = f"ℹ️ You're already a member of **{extracted_data['group_name']}**.\\n\\nNo changes needed!"
    if channel:
        send_slack_message(channel, msg)
        track_user_message(user_id, msg, is_bot_response=True)
    # Update conversation with outcome
    try:
        interactions_table.update_item(
            Key={'interaction_id': interaction_id},
            UpdateExpression='SET outcome = :outcome',
            ExpressionAttributeValues={
                ':outcome': 'Already a member - no action needed'
            }
        )
    except Exception as update_error:
        print(f"Warning: Could not update conversation outcome: {update_error}")
    return {'statusCode': 200, 'body': 'Already a member'}
elif membership_status == "USER_NOT_FOUND":
    msg = "❌ Could not find your account in Active Directory. Please contact IT."
    if channel:
        send_slack_message(channel, msg)
        track_user_message(user_id, msg, is_bot_response=True)
    return {'statusCode': 400, 'body': 'User not found'}
elif membership_status == "GROUP_NOT_FOUND":
    msg = f"❌ Group **{extracted_data['group_name']}** not found in Active Directory."
    if channel:
        send_slack_message(channel, msg)
        track_user_message(user_id, msg, is_bot_response=True)
    return {'statusCode': 400, 'body': 'Group not found'}
elif membership_status == "ERROR":
    print(f"⚠️ Membership check failed, proceeding with approval (fail open)")
```

## Impact
- Prevents unnecessary IT approvals
- Eliminates confusing duplicate messages
- Consistent with issue #47 fix (group validation before approval)
- Adds 4-6 seconds to request processing for membership check

## Testing Required

### Test 1: Already a Member
1. Request access to SSO group you're already in
2. Expected: Single message "You're already a member" - NO approval created
3. Verify: No approval in IT channel, conversation history shows "Already a member"

### Test 2: Not a Member
1. Request access to SSO group you're NOT in
2. Expected: "Submitted to IT for approval" message
3. Verify: Approval appears in IT channel

### Test 3: Invalid Group
1. Request access to non-existent SSO group
2. Expected: "Group not found" error message
3. Verify: No approval created

### Test 4: Invalid User
1. Request access for non-existent user email
2. Expected: "Could not find account" error message
3. Verify: No approval created

### Test 5: Membership Check Failure
1. Simulate AD connectivity issue
2. Expected: System proceeds with approval (fail open)
3. Verify: Approval created despite check failure

## Deployment Steps
1. Refresh AWS credentials
2. Deploy updated Lambda:
   ```bash
   aws lambda update-function-code \
     --function-name it-helpdesk-bot \
     --zip-file fileb:///Users/matt/lambda_it_bot_fixed.zip \
     --region us-east-1
   ```
3. Run Test 1 (already a member)
4. Run Test 2 (not a member)
5. Verify no other workflows broken
