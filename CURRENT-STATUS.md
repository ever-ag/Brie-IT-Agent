## ‚úÖ FIXED ISSUES

### Issue #85, #86, #87: Approval Requests Not Appearing in IT Channel
**Root Cause:** Lambda handler misconfiguration
- Handler was set to: `it-approval-system.lambda_handler`
- Correct handler: `approval_system_with_bot_callback.lambda_handler`

**Fix Applied:** Updated Lambda configuration
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED - All approval workflows now working

**Test Results:**
- SSO group request (14:21 UTC): ‚úÖ Success - Approval sent, processed, user added
- Shared mailbox request (14:23 UTC): ‚úÖ Approval sent and processed (but execution failed - see below)

## ‚ùå REMAINING ISSUES

### Issue #1: "Unknown Users ‚Üí Unknown Target" in Shared Mailbox Approvals
**Status:** ‚ùå NOT FIXED (Issue #81 fix did not resolve this)

**Evidence from logs (14:23 UTC):**
```
"For user:" "Unknown Users"
"Group:" "Unknown Target"
```

**Expected:**
```
"For user:" "matthew.denecke@ever.ag"
"Shared Mailbox:" "itsupport@ever.ag"
```

**Location:** The issue is in how the it-approval-system Lambda formats the Slack message for shared mailbox requests.

### Issue #2: Exchange Online Authentication Failure
**Status:** ‚ùå CRITICAL - Shared mailbox operations failing

**Error from brie-infrastructure-connector (14:23 UTC):**
```
Error Acquiring Token:
Unknown Status: Unexpected
Error: 0xffffffff80070520
Context: (pii)
Tag: 0x21420087 (error code -2147023584)
```

**Impact:** 
- Approval system works correctly
- But actual execution fails when trying to add users to shared mailboxes
- Users receive failure notification: "Failed to add matthew.denecke@ever.ag to itsupport@ever.ag"

**Likely Causes:**
1. Certificate expired for Exchange Online service principal
2. App registration credentials invalid
3. Service principal permissions revoked/changed

**Next Steps:**
1. Check Azure AD app registration for brie-infrastructure-connector
2. Verify certificate expiration dates
3. Validate Exchange Online API permissions
4. Check service principal credentials in Lambda environment variables

## üîç INVESTIGATION NEEDED

1. **Exchange Online Authentication**
   - Lambda: brie-infrastructure-connector
   - Check environment variables for certificate/credentials
   - Verify Azure AD app registration

2. **Slack Message Formatting**
   - Lambda: it-approval-system
   - Function: Format shared mailbox approval messages
   - Why is user/mailbox info not displaying correctly?

3. **Dashboard Logging**
   - Verify conversations are being logged to DynamoDB
   - Check if recent requests appear in dashboard
