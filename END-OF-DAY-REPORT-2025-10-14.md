# End of Day Report - October 14, 2025

## Summary
Implemented Bug #14: Conversation timeout workflow with engagement prompts, auto-close, and conversation resumption features.

## Work Completed

### Bug #14: Conversation Timeout & Engagement Prompts
**Status:** Implementation complete, awaiting final user testing

#### Features Delivered
1. **Engagement Prompts** ✅
   - 5 minutes: First prompt
   - 10 minutes: Second prompt
   - Message: "👋 Are you still there? Do you still need help with {issue}?"
   - Uses AWS EventBridge Scheduler for precise timing

2. **Timeout Logic** ✅
   - 15 minutes: Auto-close
   - Message: "⏱️ Your session has timed out. Conversation closed."
   - Outcome: "Timed Out - No Response"
   - Tracks `last_message_timestamp` (only user messages reset timer)

3. **Conversation Resumption** ✅
   - Detects closed conversations < 24 hours old
   - Prompts: "Is this related to your previous issue?"
   - Yes button: Resumes previous conversation
   - No button: Creates new conversation

4. **Approval Workflow Separation** ✅
   - Conversations awaiting approval create new conversations for new issues
   - Approval conversations excluded from resumption prompts

### Bugs Fixed
1. **Decimal Type Mismatch** - DynamoDB Decimal vs float incompatibility
2. **Missing Library** - `requests` not available in Lambda, replaced with `urllib`
3. **Lambda Timeout** - `time.sleep()` blocking, replaced with EventBridge Scheduler
4. **Timer Reset Issue** - Bot prompts were resetting inactivity timer
5. **Approval Continuation** - New issues continued approval conversations
6. **Resumption Loop** - Approval conversations triggered resumption prompt
7. **Button Complexity** - Simplified action_ids for better parsing

### Testing Performed
- ✅ Engagement prompts (tested with 1-2-3 min intervals)
- ✅ Timeout logic (all messages arrived on schedule)
- ✅ Approval separation (new issues create new conversations)
- ⏳ Resumption buttons (awaiting user confirmation)

### AWS Infrastructure Changes
**New Resources:**
- EventBridgeSchedulerRole (IAM role)
- EventBridge Scheduler permissions added to Lambda role

**Modified Resources:**
- Lambda function: it-helpdesk-bot (multiple deployments)
- DynamoDB: brie-it-helpdesk-bot-interactions (schema unchanged, new fields used)

### Code Statistics
- **Commits:** 10
- **Files Modified:** 1 (lambda_it_bot_confluence.py)
- **Lines Changed:** ~200 additions, ~60 deletions
- **Functions Added:** 2 (handle_resumption_response, schedule_auto_resolve updated)
- **Functions Modified:** 4 (get_or_create_conversation, update_conversation, engagement handlers)

### Rollback Points Created
1. `pre-bug14-timeout-fix` - Before any changes
2. `bug14-engagement-prompts-working` - After engagement prompts working

### Related Issues
- **Issue #14:** Main implementation (open for testing)
- **Issue #15:** Approval timeout ticket creation (separate, not started)
- **Issue #16:** New topic detection (future enhancement)

## Metrics

### Development Time
- **Total:** ~3.5 hours
- **Implementation:** 2 hours
- **Debugging:** 1 hour
- **Testing:** 0.5 hours

### Deployment Count
- **Total Deployments:** 10
- **Successful:** 6
- **Rollbacks:** 1
- **Failed:** 3

### Code Quality
- **Syntax Errors:** 0
- **Runtime Errors Fixed:** 7
- **Test Coverage:** Manual testing only
- **Documentation:** Inline comments + GitHub issues

## Outstanding Items

### Immediate (Before Close)
- [ ] User confirmation of resumption buttons working
- [ ] 24-hour production monitoring
- [ ] Verify no edge cases with approval workflows

### Future Enhancements (Separate Issues)
- [ ] Issue #15: Approval timeout ticket creation (5 days)
- [ ] Issue #16: New topic detection
- [ ] Automated testing for timeout workflows
- [ ] Metrics dashboard for engagement prompt response rates

## Lessons Learned

1. **DynamoDB Types:** Always convert Decimal to float for timestamp math
2. **Lambda Limitations:** Can't use `time.sleep()` for long delays, use EventBridge Scheduler
3. **Library Dependencies:** Lambda doesn't include `requests`, use built-in `urllib`
4. **Testing Strategy:** Test with short intervals (1-2-3 min) before production (5-10-15 min)
5. **Rollback Points:** Create tags before major workflow changes
6. **Button Action IDs:** Keep simple, avoid complex parsing with UUIDs

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. Add automated tests for timeout workflows
2. Monitor CloudWatch for engagement prompt execution
3. Track user response rates to engagement prompts
4. Add dashboard metrics for timeout outcomes

### Long Term
1. Consider Step Functions for complex timeout workflows
2. Implement conversation resumption analytics
3. Add A/B testing for engagement prompt timing
4. Create Lambda layer for shared dependencies
