# End of Day Report - October 13, 2025

## Summary
Completed multiple critical fixes and improvements to the Brie IT Agent system and IT Helpdesk Bot.

---

## üéØ Issues Resolved

### 1. Brie Email Agent - Image Processing
**Issue:** Bot incorrectly claimed it "cannot view images" when images were actually being processed by Claude Vision.

**Fix:**
- Removed false messaging from `generate_specific_questions()` function
- Bot now correctly processes images without claiming inability to view them
- Tested with embedded images - confirmed working

**Files Modified:**
- `brie-mailbox-poller.py`

**Deployed:** ‚úÖ Lambda function updated

---

### 2. Hardware Request Detection
**Issue:** Ticket "Rachel Ranslow needs to be setup on an Ever.ag laptop" was not caught by hardware detection.

**Root Cause:** Keyword list too narrow - only had "new laptop", "replace laptop", etc.

**Fix:**
- Added 10 new keyword variations:
  - 'needs a laptop'
  - 'needs a computer'
  - 'setup on a laptop'
  - 'setup on a computer'
  - 'setup on an'
  - 'new computer'
  - 'needs an ever.ag laptop'
  - 'needs an ever.ag computer'
  - 'laptop for'
  - 'computer for'

**Files Modified:**
- `brie-mailbox-poller.py`

**Deployed:** ‚úÖ Lambda function updated

---

### 3. Daily Admin Task Detection
**Issue:** "Daily Admin Non-billable task" emails were not being ignored.

**Root Cause:** Detection only looked for exact phrase "daily admin task".

**Fix:**
- Expanded detection to include:
  - 'daily admin task'
  - 'daily admin non-billable task'
  - 'non-billable task'

**Files Modified:**
- `brie-mailbox-poller.py`

**Deployed:** ‚úÖ Lambda function updated

---

### 4. IT Helpdesk Bot - Distribution List Name Extraction
**Issue:** User asked about "All Employees" distribution list, but bot searched for "IT email list" (hardcoded default).

**Root Cause:** Regex patterns failed to extract list name, fell back to hardcoded "IT email list".

**Fix:**
- Removed hardcoded default (now returns `None`)
- Added improved regex patterns to catch:
  - "update the [name] distribution list"
  - "help with [name] distribution list"
  - "All Employees"
- Added error handling when name cannot be extracted

**Files Modified:**
- `lambda_it_bot_confluence.py`

**Deployed:** ‚úÖ Lambda function updated

---

### 5. IT Helpdesk Bot - Bulk Distribution List Updates
**Issue:** User wanted to add/remove multiple people from distribution list, but bot only handles "add me to" requests.

**Fix:**
- Created `is_bulk_distribution_list_update()` function
- Detects:
  - Multiple bullet points (‚Ä¢)
  - Multiple add/remove operations
  - Requests affecting other users (not just self)
- Routes bulk updates to ticket creation instead of automation

**Files Modified:**
- `lambda_it_bot_confluence.py`

**Deployed:** ‚úÖ Lambda function updated

---

### 6. Dashboard - Invalid Date Display
**Issue:** Conversation history showed "Invalid Date" instead of timestamps.

**Root Cause:** Multiple timestamp formats in DynamoDB:
- Unix epoch in seconds (e.g., `1760358754`)
- Unix epoch in milliseconds
- ISO format strings (e.g., `"2025-10-13T14:05:18.123456"`)

**Fix:**
- Updated Lambda to store both ISO and `timestamp_ms` (milliseconds) for new conversations
- Updated dashboard JavaScript to handle ALL formats:
  - `timestamp_ms`: Use directly
  - `timestamp` as number < 4102444800: Multiply by 1000 (seconds ‚Üí milliseconds)
  - `timestamp` as number >= 4102444800: Use directly (milliseconds)
  - `timestamp` as string: Add 'Z' for UTC parsing

**Files Modified:**
- `lambda_it_bot_confluence.py`
- `brie-it-helpdesk-bot-dashboard-v2.html`

**Deployed:** ‚úÖ Lambda + S3 + CloudFront invalidation
