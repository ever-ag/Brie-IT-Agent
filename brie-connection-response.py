We acknowledge the difficulties you're experiencing.

It's important to note that a robust and stable internet connection is crucial for accessing VPN and AWS servers. We kindly ask that you perform the following steps:

1. Open a web browser on your computer and mobile device (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
2. In the address bar at the top of the browser, type 'www.speedtest.net' and press Enter.
3. Wait for the Speedtest.net homepage to load completely.
4. On the homepage, locate the large 'GO' button in the center of the screen.
5. Click the 'GO' button to begin the speed test.
6. The test will measure your download speed, upload speed, ping, and latency.
7. Wait for the test to complete. This usually takes less than a minute.
8. Once the test is finished, your results will be displayed on the screen.
9. Please screenshot the results on both your computer and mobile device and provide these to IT. (Reply All to the Genuity Ticket and attach screenshots to email)
