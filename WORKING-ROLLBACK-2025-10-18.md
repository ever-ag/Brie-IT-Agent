# Working Rollback - October 18, 2025

## Summary
Rolled back Issue #50 changes that broke the SSO workflow. System restored to working state from 10:01 AM.

## What Happened
1. **10:01 AM** - System working correctly with Issue #47 fix (pre-approval group validation)
2. **10:34 AM** - Deployed Issue #50 fix (membership check before approval)
3. **10:35-10:45 AM** - System broken - SSO requests bypassing validation, creating approvals immediately
4. **10:47 AM** - Rolled back to 10:01 AM working state

## Root Cause of Breakage
Issue #50 added membership check that:
- Returned ERROR status for malformed group names (e.g., "Clickup Sso*")
- Was set to "fail open" and proceed with approval on errors
- Bypassed the group validation logic from Issue #47
- Created approvals even when groups didn't exist

## Working State Restored
**Current behavior (CORRECT):**
```
User: "add me to the clickup sso"
→ Bot: "Group Not Found. Did you mean ClickUp?" ✅
→ User: "ClickUp"
→ Bot: "Request sent to IT for approval" ✅
```

**Broken behavior (FIXED):**
```
User: "add me to the clickup sso"
→ Bot: "Request sent to IT for approval" ❌
(No validation, immediate approval creation)
```

## Issue #50 Status
- **Status:** Needs redesign
- **Problem:** Membership check approach conflicts with group validation
- **Next Steps:** 
  1. Fix group name extraction to not add asterisks
  2. Ensure membership check doesn't bypass validation
  3. Test thoroughly before redeploying

## Verification
Test command: "add me to the clickup sso"
Expected: Bot asks for clarification BEFORE IT approval ✅
Verified: Working as expected
